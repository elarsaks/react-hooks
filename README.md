# React Hooks

This is a straightforward React application demonstrating the usage of 9 essential React Hooks.



### [*LIVE EXAMPLE*](https://elarsaks.github.io/react-hooks/) ____ ðŸš§ UNDER DEVELOPMENT ðŸš§ (5/9 hooks)

## Introduction

While developing my main hobby project, [Go-Blockchain](https://github.com/elarsaks/Go-blockchain), I realized that my knowledge of React's lifecycle methods wasn't translating effectively to the use of React Hooks in functional components. Therefore, I decided to create this small project as a learning exercise. 

If you face similar challenges with React Hooks, you're welcome to use this code as a learning resource and playground.

## Features (Hooks)

- [useCallback](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback)
- [useContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext)
- [useCustomHook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCustomHook)
- [useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect)
- [useLayout](https://react.dev/reference/react/useLayout)
- [useMemo](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo)
- [useReducer](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer)
- [useRef](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef)
- [useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState)


## Getting Started

The following instructions will guide you on how to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and learning purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If not, they can be downloaded and installed from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation and Running the App

First, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yelarsaks/react-hooks.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd react-hooks
```

Next, install the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Finally, start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

Your application should now be running and accessible at http://localhost:3000.
